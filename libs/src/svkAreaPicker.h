// .NAME svkAreaPicker - Picks props behind a selection rectangle on a viewport.
//
// .SECTION Description
// The svkAreaPicker picks all vtkProp3Ds that lie behind the screen space 
// rectangle from x0,y0 and x1,y1. The selection is based upon the bounding
// box of the prop and is thus not exact.
//
// Like vtkPicker, a pick results in a list of Prop3Ds because many props may 
// lie within the pick frustum. You can also get an AssemblyPath, which in this
// case is defined to be the path to the one particular prop in the Prop3D list
// that lies nearest to the near plane. 
//
// This picker also returns the selection frustum, defined as either a
// vtkPlanes, or a set of eight corner vertices in world space. The vtkPlanes 
// version is an ImplicitFunction, which is suitable for use with the
// vtkExtractGeometry. The six frustum planes are in order: left, right, 
// bottom, top, near, far
//
// Because this picker picks everything within a volume, the world pick point 
// result is ill-defined. Therefore if you ask this class for the world pick 
// position, you will get the centroid of the pick frustum. This may be outside
// of all props in the prop list.
//
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkInteractorStyleRubberBandPick, vtkExtractSelectedFrustum.
