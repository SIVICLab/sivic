// .NAME vtkExtractVOI - select piece (e.g., volume of interest) and/or subsample structured points dataset

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractVOI is a filter that selects a portion of an input structured
// points dataset, or subsamples an input dataset. (The selected portion of
// interested is referred to as the Volume Of Interest, or VOI.) The output of
// this filter is a structured points dataset. The filter treats input data
// of any topological dimension (i.e., point, line, image, or volume) and can
// generate output data of any topological dimension.
//
// To use this filter set the VOI ivar which are i-j-k min/max indices that
// specify a rectangular region in the data. (Note that these are 0-offset.)
// You can also specify a sampling rate to subsample the data.
//
// Typical applications of this filter are to extract a slice from a volume
// for image processing, subsampling large volumes to reduce data size, or
// extracting regions of a volume with interesting data.
