/*! 
 *  This class corrects for the time shift of spectra in the 
 *  EPSI direction that results from the EPSI sampling trajectory. 
 *  For each TR, the spectra from neighboring K space values along 
 *  the EPSI k-space axis are displaced in time relative to one
 *  another by Dt (time between EPSI samples).  This time-domain 
 *  shift is corrected here via the Fourier shift theorem, by applying
 *  a linear phase shift to the spectra in the frequency domain, 
 *  where the magnitude of the phase shift is a linear functino of the
 *  distance of the spectrum from the origin of k-space (in EPSI 
 *  direction).  Spectra are then inverse FT'd back to the time domain 
 *  resulting in a rectilinear spectral/spatial data set (see Figure 3 
 *  and equation 3 in the following reference).
