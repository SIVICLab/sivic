/*!
 *  svkBoxPlot generates and handles an actor to be used in a plot grid.\
 *  This actor is a poly line, and its orginal coordinate system is inherently
 *  maintained. This mean that its x range is 0-npoints and y range is the min
 *  and max magnitudes of the data array that is input. The actor is then scaled
 *  to match the geometry of the current range, and location of the voxel in the
 *  given scan. It has a method called "initialize" which will create a legitimate
 *  actor, with all values zero-- to be used for testing purposes.
 *
 *  TODO: This class extends vtkActor, and overrides its RenderOpaqueGeometry. 
 *        this allows the object to be added to collections, and renders (where 
 *        it renders properly, but the actor still does not behave exactly as it
 *        should. It has an internal actor that is rendered for the 
 *        RenderOpaqueGemoetry, but when you use Get/SetProperty it has to be
 *        manually passed to this internal actor. This may be the only way to do
 *        it, but it may be worth checking out to see if there is a better way.
 *
 *  NOTE: This class is deprecated and no longer in use.
