/*! 
 *  WARNING:  
 *  This Algorithm is a beta version for RSNA that simply adds the complex values from each coil without weighting. 

 *  Class that combines single coild data into a combined image.  Complex data must be in phase prior to combining for 
 *  constructive addition of complex data (see svkMultiCoilPhase).  Sum of squares outputs magnitude data and is not
 *  sensitive to the phase of the complex input data. The weighting factors used in the linear 
 *  combination may be set from a) spatially dependent coil sensitivity maps (experimentally derived or other), 
 *  b) peak amplitude (e.g. h20 peak), or constant. 
 *  
 *  This is(will be) based on methodes derived and validated in 
 *  the Sarah Nelson lab at UCSF, Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging.
