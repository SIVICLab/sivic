/*! 
 *  Class that combines data from multiple recive coils into a combined image.  Complex data must be in phase prior 
 *  to combining for constructive addition of complex data (see svkMultiCoilPhase).  Sum of squares outputs 
 *  magnitude data and is not sensitive to the phase of the complex input data. The weighting factors used in the 
 *  linear combination may be set from 
 *      a) spatially dependent coil sensitivity maps (experimentally derived, e.g. ASSET CAL,  or other), 
 *      b) peak amplitude (e.g. h20 peak), or constant. 
 *
 *  For weighted combinations the output signal is scaled by a global 
 *  factor (maxInputIntensity/maxOutputIntensity) to retain
 *  the same approximate overall signal level between input and output.
 *  
 *  This is based on methodes derived and validated in 
 *  the Sarah Nelson lab at UCSF, Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging.
