/*! 
 *  This is a concrete instance of an svkVarianFIDMapper for Varian 3D compressed 
 *  sensing data.  This mapper is used by the svkVarianFidReader to convert Varian 
 *  FID/Procpar data, from the UCSF compressed sensing pulse sequence, into an 
 *  svkImageData object  (includeing a DICOM MR Spectroscopy header). The Varian 
 *  compressed sensing pulse sequence was implemented by Dr. Sukumar Subramaniam 
 *  (UCSF NMR Lab) based on the work of Drs. Hu, Lustig et al.:
 *      Simon Hu, Michael Lustig, Asha Balakrishnan, Peder E. Z. Larson, Robert Bok, 
 *      John Kurhanewicz, Sarah J. Nelson, Andrei Goga, John M. Pauly, Daniel B. Vigneron: 
 *      "3D compressed sensing for highly accelerated hyperpolarized 13c mrsi with in 
 *      vivo applications to transgenic mouse models of cancer", Magn. Reson. Med., 
 *      63(2), 312-321 (2009).
 * 
 *  This mapper takes the sparsely sampled compressed sensing k-space data and reorganizes 
 *  it into a rectalinear data array with kt, kx, ky and kz organized into a regular 4D grid 
 *  with missing points from undersampling filled in with zeros. At the moment, the data 
 *  sampling order is hardcoded into this class for this specific acquisition. 
 *
 *  This missing k-space data from undersampling (encoded in the output data as zeros) needs 
 *  to be filled in using the L1 algorithm described here: 
 *      Lusting M, Donoho D.L., Pauly J.M: "Sparse MRI: the application of compressed sensing for 
 *      rapid MR imaging", Magn. Reson. Med., 58, 1182-1195 (2007). 
 *
 *  Additionally, phase correction for the flyback encoding needs to be accounted for by 
 *  downstream algorithms. 
 *
 *  Thanks to Dr. Simon Hu and Dr. Sukumar Subramaniam from the Vigneron and Kurhanewicz labs 
 *  at the UCSF Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging for help implementing this class.
