/*! 
 *  Applies vtk FFT algorithms to svkMriImageData objects. In contrast to the 
 *  vtkImageFFT and vtkImageRFFT svkMriImageFFT performs both forward and reverse 
 *  FFT's. The domain is defined by the SetFFTMode method. Also this algorithm is
 *  by default not in place, but by using the SetOperateInPlace method you
 *  can force the algorithm to overate in place. Input can be any data type, but
 *  output for the FFT is complex doubles and the output for RFFT is real doubles.
