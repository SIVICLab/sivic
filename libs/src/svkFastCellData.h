/*! 
 *  The purpose of this class is to create a fast method for adding arrays to cell data.
 *  VTK's implementation is an order N operation to add arrays so adding N arrays becomes
 *  N^2 and is slow for large data sets. To get around this svkFastCellData permits the
 *  adding of arrays without checking for duplicates and without updating the number of
 *  components. The method FinishAddArray is used to complete the process and updates
 *  the components.
 *
 *  This object also overrides the DeepCopy method to use the Fast Adding methodology.
