This hyperpolarized agent DICOM tool allows for a set of DICOM attributes to store HP 13C MRI metadata such as those which are related to the hyperpolarized agent. The basic workflow of the python script created using the packages PyDicom and OS is as follows. User input is required for the parameter of a directory path that leads to a folder containing the DICOM images or a single DICOM image. The contents of the said folder are then sorted in numerical order. Secondly, the user will provide their input for each attribute, by adding their own value or choosing from a list of default variable that will then be assigned to the attributes. Lastly, it will loop through the folder and add all the attributes to each DICOM file. 

This tool has successfully been applied to demonstrations from a metabolite-specific EPI sequence on a GE 3T scanner, reconstructed with a custom implementation based on the GE Orchestra package, DICOM from Bruker 2D CSI scan generated by SIVIC, and a DICOM from a GE EPSI sequence generated by SIVIC.
